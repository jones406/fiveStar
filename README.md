* Display user favorites on the profile page
* After sign in, re-render nav so it doesn’t show sign up or log-in, but instead log-out
* Validate restaurant and drink name to prevent duplicates.
* Expand the search outside of Austin.
* Users can search and see if their favorites match another person’s favorites.
* Add and monitor reviews, message board/chat, comment on reviews.
